# Magnitude

Python implementation of the algorithm presented in Appendix A of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11363) which concerns the Magnitude function.

Some more in-depth explanation can be found in chapter 5 of [my thesis](https://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10399/4557/LoucaN_0122_macsSS.pdf?sequence=1). Page 47 includes a diagram about how the code should be applied.
